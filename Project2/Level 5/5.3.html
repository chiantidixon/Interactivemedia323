				It lies in our hands in crystals too intricate to decipher
		
				It goes into the skillet without being given a second thought

				It spills on the floor so fine we step all over it

				We carry a pinch behind each eyeball

				It breaks out on our foreheads

				We store it inside our bodies in secret wineskins

				At supper, we pass it around the table talking of holidays and the sea.
